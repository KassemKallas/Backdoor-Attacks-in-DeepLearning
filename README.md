# AI-Backdoor
The aim of this Github repository is to gather and summarise Backdoor in AI resources. In particular, we will list and present attacks and defenses on AI and Deep Learning systems together with code repositories if exist.
In addition, we will try to categorize the attacks and defenses based on the threat model, the amount of knowledge available to the attacker and the defender and the adversarial settings.

Keywords: "Backdoor attacks", "Adversarial attacks", "Trojans", "Neural Trojans"
